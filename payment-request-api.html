      <h1>The Payment Request API</h1>
      <div>
        Many problems related to online shopping-cart abandonment can be traced
        to checkout forms, which can be difficult and time consuming to fill out
        and often require multiple steps to complete. The Payment Request API is
        meant to reduce the number of steps needed to complete a payment online,
        potentially doing away with checkout forms. It aims to make the checkout
        process easier, by remembering a user's details, which are then passed
        along to a merchant hopefully without requiring a HTML form.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Fast purchase experience:</b> Users enter their details once into
          the browser and are then ready to pay for goods and services on the
          web. They no longer have to fill out the same details repeatedly
          across different sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Consistent experience on every site (that supports the API):</b> As
          the payment sheet is controlled by the browser, it can tailor the
          experience to the user. This can include localizing the UI into the
          user's preferred language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Accessibility:</b> As the browser controls the input elements of
          the payment sheet, it can assure consistent keyboard and screen reader
          accessibility on every website without developers needing to do
          anything. A browser could also adjust the font size or color contrast
          of the payment sheet, making it more comfortable for the user to make
          a payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Credentials management:</b> Users can manage their credit cards and
          shipping addresses directly in the browser. A browser can also sync
          these &ldquo;credentials&rdquo; across devices, making it easy for
          users to jump from desktop to mobile and back again when buying
          things.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Consistent error handling:</b> The browser can check the validity
          of card numbers, and can tell the user if a card has expired (or is
          about to expire). The browser can automatically suggest which card to
          use based on past usage patterns or restrictions from the merchant
          (e.g, &ldquo;we only accept Visa or Mastercard&rdquo;), or allow the
          user to say which is their default/favorite card.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        To request a payment, a web page creates a
        <pre>PaymentRequest</pre>
        object in response to a user action that initiates a payment, such as
        clicking a &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; button. The PaymentRequest allows the
        web page to exchange information with the user agent while the user
        provides input to complete the transaction.
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <b>Note:</b> The API is available inside cross-origin
        <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements only if they have had the
        allowpaymentrequest attribute set on them.
